# kwxFFI

C-language wrapper functions around wxWidgets C++ classes, enabling foreign languages to use wxWidgets for building GUI applications.

## ⚠️ Warning: Not Production Ready

**Do not use this library in production.**

This repository is being made public solely to work around GitHub's limitation where coding agents cannot update submodules between private repositories, even when both have the same owner.

Current status:
- No language bindings implemented yet
- No test suite
- No documentation
- Expect significant API churn as language bindings are developed

This library should not be used until the language ports that depend on it are implemented and stabilized.

The original FFI code came from the wxHaskell (https://codeberg.org/wxHaskell/wxHaskell) team. A huge thanks go out to this team for creating a complete wxWidgets 3.2 interface!
