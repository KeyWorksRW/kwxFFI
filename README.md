# kwxFFI

C-language wrapper functions around wxWidgets C++ classes, enabling foreign languages to use wxWidgets for building GUI applications.

## ⚠️ Warning: Not Production Ready

**Do not use this library in production.**

This repository is being made public solely to work around GitHub's limitation where coding agents cannot update submodules between private repositories, even when both have the same owner.

Current status:
- No language bindings implemented yet
- No test suite
- No documentation
- Expect significant API churn as language bindings are developed

This library should not be used until the language ports that depend on it are implemented and stabilized.

# Credits

The original FFI code came from the wxHaskell (https://codeberg.org/wxHaskell/wxHaskell) team, which in turn was inspired by wxc project. A huge thanks go out to these teams for creating the original wxWidgets 3 interface!
